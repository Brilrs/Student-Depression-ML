# Student Depression ML

Predictive model for student depression risk using Machine Learning | Detect early signs of depression | Classification based on academic & lifestyle factors

---

## Summary
This project addresses the growing challenge of mental health in educational settings, focusing on early detection of student depression. The main goal is to develop and evaluate a predictive model using Machine Learning techniques to classify students by their risk level (low, medium, or high) of exhibiting depression symptoms.

Following the CRISP-DM methodology, the project uses the "Student Depression Dataset" from Kaggle, containing key predictor variables such as academic pressure, sleep habits, financial stress, and family mental health history. The development includes training and comparing supervised classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. Model performance is validated using robust metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.

The final result aims to provide a tool for institutional wellbeing teams to design personalized preventive strategies, improving academic performance, reducing dropout rates, and strengthening comprehensive student support.

## Introduction
Educational institutions increasingly face the responsibility of ensuring students' overall wellbeing. Mental health has become a critical factor that directly affects academic and personal success. However, identifying issues like depression often relies on reactive methods such as self-reports, creating a gap between symptom onset and timely intervention. Early detection is crucial to prevent negative consequences for both students and the institution.

This project proposes predictive analytics and Machine Learning as a proactive solution. The objective is to build a classification model to identify students most likely to develop depression symptoms based on study habits, sleep quality, stress levels, and personal environment.

The project follows the standard CRISP-DM framework, covering business understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment planning. Each phase is detailed to deliver an analytical solution that not only predicts risk but also provides valuable insights for institutional decision-making.
